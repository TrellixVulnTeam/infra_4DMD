# Golang project snapshot

Each project written in Golang language has at least one dependency.
In order to build a project all required dependencies must be available.
Each dependency corresponds to a commit (or version) of a project.

The dependency state space is defined as a graph.
Each node corresponds to one project of a given commit (or version).
Each edge corresponds to dependency between two projects.

Snapshot of a golang project is a minimal subset of dependency state space
needed to build the project.

## Representation of the snapshot

There are various ways to represent the state space:

* Godeps.json generated by [github.com/tools/godep](https://github.com/tools/godep)
* GLOCKFILE generated by [github.com/robfig/glock](https://github.com/robfig/glock)
* other formats with list of dependencies

## Reconstruction

Some projects do not provide any such representation.
The simpleast way to approximate/reconstruct the snapshot is to take
commit date of a project in question and find commits of all required dependencies
closest (at most) to given date.
